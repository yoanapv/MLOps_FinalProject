# Baseline Model

**HOTEL RESERVATIONS**

**Problem type:** Classification (Binary)

**Problem description:**
*   The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior
*   A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows.
*   The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

**Goal:**
We need to determine if each customer is likely to cancel their reservation or not.
