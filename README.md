**HOTEL RESERVATIONS**

**Problem type:** Classification (Binary)

**Problem description:**
*   The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customers’ behavior
*   A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows.
*   The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

**Goal:**
We need to determine if each customer is likely to cancel their reservation or not.

**Follow the instructions below to do the activity**
### Run the existing notebook
1. Clone the project `https://github.com/yoanapv/MLOps_FinalProject.git` on your local computer.
2. Open the Terminal
    * Clic on Terminal --> New Terminal

    * Press Ctrl + Shift + Ñ

3. Create a virtual environment with `Python 3.10.9`
    * Create venv (Windows)
        ```
        py -3.10 -m venv venv
        ```

    * Create venv (mac)
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

    * Activate the virtual environment (Windows)

        ```
        venv/scripts/Activate.ps1
        ```

    * Activate the virtual environment (mac)

        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        You'll see the name of the virtual environment, in parentheses, at the beginning of the code line.

4. Install libraries
    Run the following command to install the libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install -r MLOps_Modulo1/requirements_3-7
